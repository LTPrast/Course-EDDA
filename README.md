# Course: Experimental Design and Data Analysis (EDDA)

In this course we learned to design experiments and do data analysis. A couple of topics that were discussed: non-parametric testing methods and 
bootstrap methods such as Wilcoxon test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, rank correlation tests, permutation and bootstrap tests. Other methods to analyze data were:
linear regression, analyses of variance (ANOVA), ANCOVA, lasso and generalized linear regression models. All analyses were  carried out by using the statistical
package R.
In this repository multiple assignments can be seen and for assignment 1 we also made a total pdf with the data analysis of all the different exercises.
This can seen in the file assignment1_report.pdf
